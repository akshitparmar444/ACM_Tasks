My research interest lies in Financial Technology.The article I have read focuses of use of machine learning models in financial markets.The author says people start trading research by gathering data. They look for patterns(alphas) in it, build machine learning models and than backtest it. 

But author tells there are lot of problems in backtesting.Backtesting is a tricky process which requires focus or it could lead to misleading results.Sometimes strategies seem good just because they fit random past patterns.According to him,If you try too many tests, the model may look perfect on old data but fail badly in the future.It is importan to understand relationship between different financial terms.



Instead of backtesting it, he advices people to focus on feature importance. Feature importance using algorithms show is some data really helps in prediction of prices or is false indicator.Using fundamental and most important features make models more stable and reliable.Also,it can change with time.



From this blog, I have learned how machine learning models can be used to make predictions.It has left me curious about SHAP values or reinforcement learning.Also , I believe there could AI trading agents in future which could take immediate trading decisions and reason out their trades.
